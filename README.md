### Which license is best for me?

⚠️ **This is not legal advice; please seek your own legal counsel.** ⚠️

**For most people,** if you're only hosting/using Checkpoint for your own company/entity, and/or its subsidiaries, the [Elastic License 2.0](./LICENSE.elastic) should be more favorable for you. While it's not an official OSI license, it's very permissive with its [main limitation being "You may not provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed service..."](./License.elastic#limitations).

If you want to "provide the software to third parties as a hosted or managed service", you must use the [AGPLv3](./LICENSE.agpl) license which is an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3). This license has more limitations and conditions, which you should read in full **and** seek legal counsel for.
