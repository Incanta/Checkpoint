# We use this provider in development for testing purposes, but it's HIGHLY DISCOURAGED
# to use in production. Ultimately, there are a lot of security
# issues with using this provider that we have not addressed in this application.
# There's also lacking functionality (like password resets).
# See https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/credentials  for details
# why this provider is not recommended for production. We recommend using any
# of the other providers listed below.
# ALSO IF THIS IS ENABLED, ALL OTHER PROVIDERS ARE IGNORED
